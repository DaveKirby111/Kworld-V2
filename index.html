                <h2>introduction</h2>

                <p>I attended college for four years at University of Montevallo where I received a B.S. in Art. I then attended Jefferson State for two years where I received an Associates in Web Technologies. I enjoy video games, comics, music and movies. I have also written some fanfiction as a way to improve my writing and storytelling abilities. I had done a lot of drawing ever since first grade and pursued art from there into college. I eventually got burnt out on it and decided to go in a different direction.</p>

    <h3>mass effect:</h3>

    <p>Mass Effect is one of my favorite franchises in video games. I loved the first game when it was more of an RPG shooter and consider it to be the best in the Shepard trilogy. That tends to be an unpopular opinion when so many fans love Mass Effect 2 more. I still love the second game, but it was the point where the games started to become more of a shooter with RPG elements. The games became oversimplified to appeal to a wider audience. In doing so it lost the gameplay elements that I loved from the first game. It did make improvements in some areas like combat. It also had more interesting characters.</p>

    <p>Mass Effect 3 is infamous for it’s ending. The backlash from the fans was so great that developer BioWare had to release an extended cut dlc for free to explain the events that transpired. Over time, the more I play Mass Effect 3 the less I want to. There are problems with the game that go beyond the ending. While the third games does have it’s bright spots, I am more likely to just play the first two.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h5>Mass Effect:</h5><p> The first game was the one that is the most RPG out of all of them. As you leveled up you would pick up better weapons, armor or mods as you went through the game. You could equip your party members with better equipmnent to be more effective in battle or live longer. You had an inventory to manage and the ability to sell what you didn’t need or want to keep.</p>
            
            <p>The Mako is your vehicle for traversing the worlds that you land on. Personally, I like the Mako. One thing the fanbase can agree on is that it did not handle well at all. The physics were not good as you would bounce around constantly while driving. It was removed in the sequels; a decision that I do not agree with. One thing that the Mako did was add to the immersion of being in space and landing on other worlds. When I left my ship I could drive around the map and investigate the different points of interest. Rather than improve on the Mako for the sequels, their answer was to remove it completely. Now, what we got was a cutscene of a shuttle landing at some location. Yeah, I would rather have the Mako.</p>

            <p>The story itself was really engaging with strong characters to meet along the way. Garrus, Wrex and Tali are fan favorites. Liara has sort of become the most prominent figure in the series. She was even given a dlc, Lair of the Shadow Broker, that was centered around her. While I do like Liara, it does feel like the developers were playing favorites when it came to her. Personally, I have always liked Ashley Williams. Though she is the most controversial character in Mass Effect. No one has divided the fans more than her.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h5>Mass Effect 2:</h5><p> As I said, this is where the series become less of an RPG and more of an action shooter with RPG elements. People complained about the inventory in Mass Effect 1, so their answer was to remove it. Along with the inventory went the ability to loot items and along with that, the ability to sell items. Upgrading your ability to do damage with weapons or abilities was done at a research terminal at the cost of resources. You collected these resources through a scanning minigame that most people who play ME2 are not a fan of. Your skill tree that you put points into when you leveled up was much smaller in 2 than in the first game. You had 5 or 6 talents to choose from while your squadmates only had 4.</p>

            <p>Mass Effect 2 is carried by the strength of it’s characters and the improvements that it made to combat. Your choices from Mass Effect 1 carried over into the second game, which was good. Mass Effect has always prided itself on having your choices matter. While Mass Effect 2 has no shortage of well written and deep characters, my favorite this time around is Miranda Lawson; who is voiced by and modeled after real life actress Yyvonne Strahovski.</p>

            <p>The story of Mass Effect 2 faulters when at the beginning of the game, your ship is attacked and Shepard dies after being thrown out into space and the orbit of a planet. Shepard is brought back two years later by a pro-human group called Cerberus. Their methods tend to be extreme, their experiments monsterous. In the first game it was established that an ancient race of machines called the Reapers nearly wiped out all life in the galaxy 50,000 years ago. Now, they are returning to do it again. The second game immediately halts the momentum that the first game set up and instead, focuses on a smaller threat called the Collectors. If you were to remove Mass Effect 2 from the trilogy, it wouldn’t matter.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h5>Mass Effect 3:</h5><p> If Mass Effect 2 oversimplified the series, Mass Effect 3 dumbed it down completely. Once again, no inventory which means no looting or selling. You have less dialogue options than the previous two games. The quest tracking is absolutely horrendous. I have never seen a journal that bad in a game before. Not only does it not track your progress in quests but it is completely disorganized. The game was so watered down that it gives you an option to have all of the dialogue choices made for you.</p>

            <p>Mass Effect 3 was made with the idea of bringing new players into the series. This is the third game in a trilogy where the story is wrapping up. The problem with trying to bring new people in at the end of a trilogy is that you have to make it in such a way that it disregards the fans who stuck with it from the beginning. It was made so accessible to a wider audience that it lost the magic that made the first game such a joy to play. Mass Effect 1 is an experience, it was something special. I still love Mass Effect 1 and 2, though the first game will always be the best in the series as far as I am concerned.

    <h3>final fantasy:</h3>

    <p>Final Fantasy 7 was the game that made me start playing video games the way that I do today. My cousin handed me the first disc and told me that I had to play it. I started playing that afternoon and didn’t stop until about 2 in the morning. I then went out and bought 7, 8, and 9. Of the newer Final Fantasy games I like 13 and 15. People heavily criticize 13 and I understand why. I have my own complaints about the game, but I still love it despite it’s flaws. I look at 15 as the antithesis of what 13 was. Square saw the backlash that 13 received for it’s linearity and overcompensated by making 15 as open as possible. They focused too much on the open world aspects of the game and not enough on telling a story.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h5>Final Fantasy 8:</h5><p> For a long time FF8 is one game in the series that I come back to the most. Even though I started with 7 there were a lot of things about 8 that I really liked. The junction and draw system, some of the characters, Triple Triad, and the story even though they tend to get criticized by fans.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h5>Final Fantasy 13:</h5><p> As I said, 13 is another game in the series that is criticized by fans and I understand why. A game can be linear without feeling like it is linear. On the other hand, a game can be so on rails that you can’t help but notice how linear it is. FF13 was on rails, even down to the way you progressed your characters. You don’t get money from battles like in previous games and in order to upgrade your weapons and accessories you have to buy items in the stores. So you have to grind enemies for items that sell for a decent amount of money; but the highest value items are rare drops. The entire process is more tedious and frustrating that it needed to be.</p>

            <p>Other than the criticisms, there are positives that make 13 one of my favorite final fantasy games. It is true that when you start the game it throws you into this world with names and terms that you don’t know the meaning of. It does not do a great job of explaining what these things are. A lot of the backstory of this game can be found in the datalog section of your menu. If you take the time to learn the story and the setting it is really interesting. I think 13 is one of those things that you get out of it what you put in to it.</p>

            <p>I like the characters and their growth throughout the game. Lightning is the face of FF13 and is often criticized for having no personality. She starts out very stoic and keeping people at arms length. She is very goal oriented and not wanting to rely on others. This is a product of losing her parents at a young age and having to take care of her sister on her own, though that is explained better in a book called Episode Zero. By the end of the game however, she has become more open to relying on others and letting down her guard. There are things that you can fairly criticize 13 for but I do not think the characters are one of them.</p>

    <h3>assassin's creed:</h3>

    <p>To talk about Assassin’s creed, let us start with the first question that is asked at the beginning of the first game. It is directed at Desmond, but since he is the character we are following in the modern day storyline we can say that the question is directed at us as well. What is a memory? The answer that Desmond gives is, a recollection of a past event. That would be an accurate description of what a memory is. Now, imagine that within our DNA we also have the memories of our ancestors; like an archive.</p>

    <p>In the world of Assassin’s Creed, there is a machine called the Animus. It decodes the memories within our DNA and renders it in a viewable format. Desmond is able to not only view but experience the life of his ancestors. Imagine gaining knowledge and skills that your ancestors possesed as if it was something forgotton and you are now remembering.</p>

    <p>Desmond Miles was raised in an order of Assissins. Since it was not a choice that he made, he eventually left the order and became a bartender. That is, until he was kidnapped by a company called Abstergo. Desmond comes from a long line of assassins. Through the Animus, we see that his ancestors were assassins.</p>

    <p>Assassin’s Creed is about a secret war between the assassins and their enemy, the templars. Abstergo is just the modern day face of the templars. It is a war between two ideologies of freedom vs control. Is it better to control mankind or should people be free to choose. This is a war taking place while unraveling the mysteries of the first civilization. The ones who came before us left behind artifacts of great power known as pieces of Eden. I refer to them as artifacts of great power but it is more accurately advanced technology.</p>

    <p>The story of Assassin’s Creed takes place in both the modern day and a historical setting. We mainly follow the life of an assassin as Desmond is following his ancestor. The first game took place during the crusades with the assassin Altair. AC 2 was set during the Italian Renaissance with Ezio. Ac 3 took place during the American Revolution. And along the way we meet historical figures like Leonardo da’ Vinci in AC 2 or Blackbeard in AC4.</p>

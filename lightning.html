                    <h3>bio:</h3>

                    <p>Claire Farron was in her early teens when she lost her father, her mother died of an illness when she was 14. She was left to take care of her sister Sarah. The way that she saw to do that was to abandon the girl that she was and become someone who was stronger and more capable; changing her name to Lightning. She joined the Guardian Corps, which is basically the police of Cocoon. Their job is to take care of any monsters that stray into populated areas and threaten the locals.</p>

                    <p>When she first meets Snow villiers, it was after taking care of some monsters in the portside city of Bodhum. She already knew that Sarah had been spending time with someone named Snow, and after their first meeting she didn’t like him. Snow is the learder of a group called N.O.R.A., no obligations, rules or authority. Part of the reason she dislikes Snow is how he reminds her of her father, who she discribes as being unreliable.
                    </p>

                    <p>Over the course of the first game, Lightning is shown to keep people at a distance, not revealing much about herself. She also doesn’t like to rely on others for help. She is as hard on other people as she is on herself. By the end of the game, she has learned to let her guard down and be more accepting of others. She even comes to accept Snow and Sarah’s relationship, congradulating them on their engagement.</p>   
                    
                    <h3>why i like her:</h3>
                    
                    <p>I like her arc throughout the first game. She is often criticized for having no character or personality by fans. 13 is a game that has divided the fanbase, you either love it or you hate it. I hate the discourse surrounding 13; while there are plenty of things to criticize it for, Lightning certainly isn’t one of them. Her journey is about letting down her guard and letting people help her.</p>

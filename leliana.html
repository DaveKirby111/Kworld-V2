                    <h3>bio:</h3>

                    <p>Leliana was a bard from Fereldan’s neihboring empire, Orlais. In Orlais, bards are often singers and storytellers but also spies. Bards are skilled at manipulating others, subterfuge as well as combat. She was tought the Bardic arts by Marjolaine, who she had met in the capital of Orlias, Val Royeaux. She became very close to Marjolaine, until she was betrayed and left to rot in a dungeon. She was able to escape, and after confronting Marjolaine chose to give up her life as a bard and become a chantry sister in Lothering.</p>

                    <p>In the main game of Origins, the player meets Leliana in Lothering. She expresses her desire to join you on your journey after having a vision from the maker. Through talking to Leliana, and if her approval rating is high enough, she will begin to open up about her past. Eventually, your party will be attacked if she is with you by men sent by Marjolaine to kill Leliana. You can then go and confront Marjolaine with Leliana, choosing to spare Marjolaine or kill her.</p>

                    <p>Whatever you decide, the encounter will leave Leliana conflicted and having a moment of doubt. She expresses her concerns to the player that she is just like Marjolaine; paranoid, cruel, and self serving. You can convince her that a bard is what she is and she shouldn’t fight it. Or, you can reassure her that she is a good person. She strives to do good and that means something.</p>

                    <h3>why i like her:</h3>

                    <p>Her story is one of redemption. She carries a dark past with her, but was able to find a renewed sense of purpose in the chantry. She is able to fight her own impulses and strive to be a better person than what she was. In Origins, the player has the opportunity to have their character pursue a romance with Leliana. What I especially like is how that romance is carried forward in the next two games. In the third game, Inquistion, Leliana can become the new Divine of the chantry. She goes so far as to change tradition so that she can continue her relationship with your character openly. I appreciate it as the player, that these relationships that I developed in the first game are not forgotten and are acknowledged in future installments that they do still exist.</p>

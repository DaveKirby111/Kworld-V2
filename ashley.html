                    <h3>bio:</h3>

                    <p>Ashley comes from a family that has served the Alliance going back to her great-grandmother. During the First Contact War, her grandfather was the first human to surrender to their alien enemy. Because of that, her family was blacklisted by the military. She enlisted after high school and made it to the rank of Gunnery Chief. Even though her scores were some of the best, she has been held back from promotion or assignments; something she refers to as the Williams curse. Her dad used to say, “A Williams as to be better than the best, if only to avoid suspision.”</p>

                   <p> Ashley is the oldest child in their family with her three sisters following. After her dad died she helped her mother raise her sisters and is very close with her family. She would even fly home to walk her youngest sister to school. She has strong religious beliefs and has a love of poetry like her parents. She often quotes poetry because she is not good with words.</p>
                        
                    <p> The player first meets Ashley on the human colony of Eden Prime during an attack that wiped out her entire unit, something that she will carry with her afterward. She officialy joins your team in stopping Saren and the Geth after that introductory mission. As is normal wih BioWare games, you can talk to her between missions and learn more about her. She is also a romance option should the player wish to pursue it.</p>

                    <h3>why i like her:</h3>

                    <p>Now that the basic info is out of the way, I have a lot to say about Ashley. She is one of my favorite characters in Mass Effect, but she is also the most divisive character in the series. There are people that lover her, hate her, or just indifferent to her. The biggest and main criticism against Ashley is that she is a “space racist” as she is referred to by the fans. The arguments brought up for this always come down to when she expresses concerns over the alien party members on your ship, a dog and bear metaphor that she makes, and a comment she makes on the Citadel. So let’s go though them.</p>

                    <p>So starting with the mentioned comment on the Citadel, it goes like this. “I can’t tell the aliens from the animals.” In Mass Effect, you have the keepers, which are insect like beings that are all over the Citadel. They work on the station and show no interaction with any other species. You also have species like the Hanar, which look like overgrown jellyfish. To someone who has had little to no expreience with other species and are being exposed to them for the first time, like Ashley, it would be hard to tell the difference between what species is sapient, intelligent or civilized and which aren’t. The writer of Ashley who worked on that first game, Chris L’Etoile, said that line was a mistake and would have written something else if he could do it again. Fans have taken that one line and use it as evidence of Ashley being racist.</p>

                    <p>Another argument that is brought up all the time is a metaphor that she makes. It goes like this, if you encounter a bear and the only way for you to survive is to sick your dog on it and run, you would. Saying that even though you love your dog, it’s not human. People have taken this and completely twisted it, thinking that she is equating other aliens to dogs and that humanity should sick them on the bear. They completely miss the point of what she is saying.</p>

                    <p>Ever since the First Contact War ended and humanity has joined the galactic community, the other races have had a grudge against humanity. Some races see humanity as being the new pets of the council, being given more than we deserve. Humanity sees itself as being treated like second class citizens. Anytime we need aid from the council, they ignore us.</p>

                    <p>What Ashley is referring to is self preservation; that if they had to choose between their survival or our survival, they will choose themselves over us. I think it is important to note that she doesn’t fault the other races for this, even calling it human nature as it is something that we would do. When the Reapers finally show up in Mass Effect 3, the other races first response is to look out for themselves rather than join you in an alliance to save Earth. That also tends to get overlooked by fans, the motivation behind the alliance. It is brought up again and again that we have to save Earth. Ashley is proven right throughout all three games. What she is saying is that humanity shouldn’t bet everything on the other races being there for us when we need them. That we should be prepared to go it alone if we have to. That is the point of her dog and bear metaphor</p>

                    <p>So in one of the first conversations you have with Ashley on your ship, the Normandy, she expresses concerns about two of the alien party members you have with you. The two party members in question are Garrus and Wrex. So the Normandy is a ship that was co-developed by humans and turians as a way to build bridges after the First Contact War. Even though it was co-developed and Shepard is now a SPECTRE, meaning he/she now only answers to the council, it is still an Alliance owned ship.</p>

                    <p>Garrus is a Turian, former Citadel Security, who left to join you because he didn’t like having to deal with red tape. He didn’t like doing things by the rules and thought that with you he would have more freedom in the way he gets the job done. Garrus is not an Alliance soldier, and he is being given free reign to mess with the Normandy’s systems. It is perfectly reasonable that Ashley, an Alliance soldier, would have an issure with this and she voices that to Shepard.</p>

                    <p>Wrex is a Krogan bounty hunter. The Krogan are a violent species that were uplifted by the Salarians to fight a species called the Rachni. When it was done, the Salarians and Turians worked together to sterilize the Krogan with a plague called the Genophage. Bounty hunters are not necesarrily known for their loyalty or willingness to take orders, so it is no surprise that Ashley would have a problem with him being given free acess to the ship. In the case of both Garrus and Wrex, there are valid reasons to be concerned about their level of access to the ship. It would be like bringing a cop or a civilian onto a US submarine and allowing them to poke around wherever they wanted. That is something that would just not fly with the US military who owns that submarine.</p>

                    <p>I have always been a defender of Ashley against the accusations of her being racist, because she isn’t. I have been in several comment sections, talking with people who claim that she is. Honestly, I think I am getting tired of it. The conversation always goes in circles with the same arguments being brought up, no one walks away convinced and it feels like nothing was accomplished. I think it is a testament to the writing that just like in real life, you are going to meet people that you just don’t like or get along with; and that is okay. Unlike characters such as Tali or Garrus that most fans can aggree are favorites. I have never seen anyone say that they outright hate Liara. I know that Ashley is not a “space racist” as they say. And you know, I can live with that.
                    </p>

                    <p>In Mass Effect 3, Ashley was given a redesign. One that I am not very happy with. In the first two games she looked like a soldier. Her hair was done up in a bun and she wore a standard Alliance uniform. Very parcticle and fitting for a soldier. In ME3, her hair is now hanging down over her shoulders and she is wearing a blue catsuit type thing. I think the idea was to make her more appealing.</p>

                    <p>The reasoning that I remember hearing for this, is that Ashley is a higher rank now so she is able to let her hair down. I do not agree with this. First of all, this is the Alliance military that we are talking about. There is a dress code. If you look around at all the other NPCs around you, they are wearing a standard Alliance uniform. Even Admiral Hackett is wearing a uniform. She could not just wear whatever she wanted. Second, even if she could, she comes from a family who have served the Alliance. She has worked hard to break the Williams curse and get to where she is. Even if she had the choice, she would choose to wear the Alliance uniform and where it proudly.</p>
